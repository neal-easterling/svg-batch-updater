# svg-batch-updater
Batch updating code on svg to reflect A4E styling, license, and standards.

## Description
A small program to parse, insert, and build svgs exported from Figma.  The inserts are completely based on my needs for apps4everyone.tech.  Should be easy to adapt the code for your needs too.

### Directions
Add svgs to /public/images. \n
run node mit.js \n
files will be updated, added to /public/output, and deleted from /public/images. \n
sample svgs provided in /public/sampleInputs \n
